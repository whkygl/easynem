## easynem introduction

This R package has a built-in Nemaplex database for nematodes, which can be used to search for various nematodes. At the same time, this R package supports various nematode communities and functional analyses such as nematode diversity, maturity index, metabolic footprint, and functional guild. This R package promises to be continuously updated, hoping to help relevant practitioners in a small way. For more details on using easynem see <https://github.com/whkygl/easynem>.
