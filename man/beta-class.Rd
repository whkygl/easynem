\title{A class to store beta diversity results (single factor)}
\description{
\code{beta-class} is used to store the results of beta diversity analysis,
including results for drawing and comparing differences between groups.
}
\details{
Users can construct a \code{beta-class} through \code{\link{calc_beta}},
which can then be connected to \code{\link{nem_plot}} to visualize the results.
