\description{
The \code{calc_ef()} function is used to calculate the energy flow of a nematode
community. For detailed calculation method, see \code{Wan et al. (2022)}: Step 1, the
fresh biomass of each nematode individuals was calculated based on the measurement
of body size or using publicly available data. Step 2, nematode metabolism (F) was
then calculated according to \code{Ferris (2010)} and \code{van den Hoogen et al. (2019)},
where Nt, Wt and mt are the number of individuals, the fresh weight and the cp class
of taxon t, respectively. Step 3, a five-node food web topology was constructed and
the feeding preferences of omnivores-carnivores on other trophic groups was assumed according
to community density. Step 4, the metabolism of each node was summed by all individual
metabolism of the respective trophic group. Step 5, we used assimilation efficiencies
(ea) of 0.25 for herbivores, 0.60 for bacterivores, 0.38 for fungivores and 0.5
for omnivores-carnivores according to \code{Barnes et al. (2014)} and \code{De Ruiter et al. (1993)}.
Step 6, energy fluxes between nodes was calculated as follows: \code{Fi = (F + L)/ea},
where L is the energy loss to higher trophic levels.
