Description: This R package has a built-in Nemaplex database for nematodes, 
    which can be used to search for various nematodes. At the same time, 
    this R package supports various nematode communities and functional 
    analyses such as nematode diversity, maturity index, metabolic footprint, 
    and functional guild. This R package promises to be continuously updated, 
    hoping to help relevant practitioners in a small way.
